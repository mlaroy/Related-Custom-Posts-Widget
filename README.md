Related-Custom-Posts-Widget
===========================

This plugin for WordPress creates a widget that will display a list of custom posts, related by category.  
The widget gives you an option to add additional classes and a title.

This plugin was originally desinged to be added to a child theme of the Support Desk theme,
found here: http://themeforest.net/item/support-desk-a-responsive-helpdesk-theme/4321280
but you can customize it to your site by specifying your own registered custom post type.

```
$args = array(
        'post_type' => 'custom_post_type', // your custom post type goes here
```
